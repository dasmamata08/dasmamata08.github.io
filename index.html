            <h3>Research Statement</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a PhD student in interdisciplinary bioinformatics and machine learning, my research focuses on leveraging computational techniques to unravel complex biological phenomena. I am driven by the challenge of integrating vast biological datasets with advanced machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights and contribute to the understanding of fundamental biological processes.</li>
                <li>My research interests lie at the intersection of biology, computer science, and statistics, where I aim to develop innovative computational methods for analyzing high-throughput biological data. Specifically, I am interested in applying machine learning approaches to genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to uncover patterns, identify biomarkers, and elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases.</li>
                <li>One of the primary goals of my research is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify and predict biological outcomes, ultimately leading to personalized diagnostics and treatments. To achieve this, I integrate various machine learning techniques, including deep learning, ensemble methods, and feature selection algorithms, with domain-specific knowledge of biology and bioinformatics.</li>
                <li>Moreover, I am passionate about developing interpretable machine learning models that not only achieve high predictive accuracy but also provide insights into the underlying biological processes. By combining computational analyses with experimental validations, I aim to bridge the gap between computational predictions and biological experiments, facilitating the translation of computational findings into actionable insights for biomedical research and clinical applications.</li></ul>
